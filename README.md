## Objectives
* Create a NumPy Array
* Operate on the NumPy Array to return an Array with new values

## Instructions

Create a NumPy Array for each of the following:
    1. Using a range
    2. Using a Python List
    
Below, create a list in Python that has 5 elements (i.e. [0,1,2,3,4]) and assign it to the variable `py_list`. 

Next, do the same, but instead of a list, create a range with 5 elements and assign it to the variable, `py_range`.

Finally, use the list and range to create NumPy arrays and assign the array from list to the variable `array_from_list`, and the array from the range to the variable `array_from_range`.


```python
import numpy as np
```


```python
py_list = None
py_range = None
array_from_list = None
array_from_range = None
```

Next, we have a list of heights and weights and we'd like to use them to create a collection of BMIs. However, they are both in inches and pounds (imperial system), respectively. 

Let's use what we know to create NumPy arrays with the metric equivalent values, (height in meters & weight in kg).

> 1.0 inch = 0.0254 meters
> 2.2046 lbs = 1 kilogram


```python
# use the conversion rate for turning height in inches to meters
list_height_inches = [65, 68, 73, 75, 78]
list_height_meters = None
```


```python
# use the conversion rate for turning weight in pounds to kilograms
list_weight_pounds = [150, 140, 220, 205, 265]
list_weight_meters = None
```

The metric formula for calculating BMI is as follows:

> BMI = weight (kg) รท height^2 (m^2)

So, to get BMI we divide weight by the squared value of height. For example, if i weighed 130kg and was 1.9 meters tall, the calculation would look like:

> BMI = 130 / (1.9*1.9)

Use the BMI calculation to create a NumPy array of BMIs


```python
BMI_array = None
```
